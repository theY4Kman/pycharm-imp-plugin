 - Resolved explicit typing annotations on requested fixtures being ignored again, in 2022.3


1.0.1, 2022-11-02
-----------------

**Fixed:**

0.7.1, 2022-06-28
-----------------

**Fixed:**
 - Resolved artifact build including test sources, some of which caused plugin incompatibilities when scanned.


0.7.0, 2022-06-17
-----------------

**Features:**
 - Add completion/references for external lambda fixtures (from appropriate `conftest.py` files, and from plugins listed in the root conftest's `pytest_plugins` and from `-p <plugin>` arguments in the pytest config's `addopts`)


0.6.0, 2022-06-15
-----------------

 - Support for PyCharm 2022.2 EAP (tested against 222.2270.35)


0.5.5, 2022-02-17
-----------------

**Fixed:**
 - Resolve `*args` types being reported incorrectly, for any function anywhere (whoops. see [GH#11](https://github.com/theY4Kman/pycharm-pytest-imp/issues/11 — thanks, [andrianovs](https://github.com/andrianovs) and [lancelote](https://github.com/lancelote))

-----------------

**Changed:**

0.5.3, 2021-11-12
-----------------

**Fixed:**
 - Allow relative paths to `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` to be used in settings (see [GH#10](https://github.com/theY4Kman/pycharm-pytest-imp/issues/10) — thanks, [kbakk](https://github.com/kbakk)!)


0.5.2, 2021-09-29
-----------------

**Changed:**
 - Support for PyCharm 2021.3 EAP (tested against 213.3714.452)

**Fixed:**
 - Resolve error with [java-configparser](https://github.com/ASzc/java-configparser) when either `python_functions` or `python_classes` were undefined when using `pytest.ini` for config.


0.5.1, 2021-07-31
-----------------

**Fixed:**
 - Resolve issue where multiline values caused error in INI config parsing  
   
   _(previously, [ini4j](http://ini4j.sourceforge.net/) was used to parse `pytest.ini`, but Python's [ConfigParser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html), which pytest uses, is not a strict implementation of INI parsing; we have switched to using the third-party [java-configparser](https://github.com/ASzc/java-configparser) to resolve this.)_

---------------

**Changed:**
 - Support for PyCharm 2021.2 EAP (tested against 212.4321.41)
